    'archie': {
        'markop': { type: 'ally', text: "Archie on Markop: A stuffy, self-righteous shield. But he's a reliable shield, and sometimes, you need one of those. He's taking forever with the kid. If you want something done, you have to nudge the 'honorable' ones in the right direction." },
        'humpik': { type: 'ally', text: "Archie on Humpik: The Dwarf is simple. Predictable. Useful for hitting things. Points in the right direction and he goes." },
        'bowser': { type: 'ally', text: "Archie on Bowser: He can yell all he wants. I'm the one who gets things done, even if it's messy. He's just another would-be king, but his desire to smash the Empire is useful. A temporary, powerful convenience." },
        'remi': { type: 'ally', text: "Archie on Remi: FNG is a surprisingly useful pawn. A little gullible, maybe. Convinced her to help a murderer hide some bodies without even trying. She's got potential... to be a great distraction." },
        'dan': { type: 'ally', text: "Archie on 'Dan': The kid's gone nuts! It's fantastic! Locking doors, causing a scene... he created the perfect cover for me to scout the place out. Best diversion I could have asked for." },
        'toad_lee': { type: 'ally', text: "Archie on Toad Lee: Big axe, bigger frown. He's useful for hitting things, but don't expect any sparkling conversation." },
        'eager': { type: 'ally', text: "Archie on Eager: So he's a bartender now for some glowing weirdo? At least he's not getting tortured anymore. Progress, I guess." },
        'roger': { type: 'ally', text: "Archie on Roger: This one's got the right idea. A gun solves a lot of problems talk can't. Smart." },
        'ryan': { type: 'ally', text: "Archie on Ryan: He's watching the kid with the staff. Good. Competition makes things interesting. Maybe he'll learn something useful, like how to make a proper explosion." },
        'bones': { type: 'ally', text: "Archie on Bones: He gets it. The world's a trash fire. He's just trying to stay warm. Respectable." },
        'emperor_elagabalus': { type: 'enemy', text: "Archie on Elagabalus: The ultimate symbol of the oppressive, boring order I despise. His Empire needs to be torn down, brick by brick." },
        'general_marcus_ironhand': { type: 'enemy', text: "Archie on Ironhand: Discipline is just another word for boring. He wouldn't know a good opportunity if it blew up in his face. I should arrange that." },
        'lord_crimson': { type: 'ally', text: "Archie on Lord Crimson: He understands the value of chaos. A dangerous, but amusing, player in the game." },
        'archmage_theron': { type: 'enemy', text: "Archie on Theron: All his rules and regulations for magic are a cage. Cages are meant to be broken." },
        'chief_thornpaw': { type: 'enemy', text: "Archie on Thornpaw: He talks to trees. Whatever. As long as he stays out of my way." },
        'high_inquisitor_vale': { type: 'enemy', text: "Archie on Vale: Another fanatic in a shiny suit who wants to burn anything fun. Get in line." },
        'captain_syrup': { type: 'enemy', text: "Archie on Captain Syrup: She's got style, I'll give her that. But she's just as greedy as the rest. Got in my way." },
        'boss_knuckles': { type: 'enemy', text: "Archie on Knuckles: Thinks he's tough. He's just another obstacle. One that's fun to blow up." },
        'alpha_bloodmaw': { type: 'ally', text: "Archie on Bloodmaw: Angry, hairy, and hates vampires. What's not to like?" },
        'chancellor_toadsworth': { type: 'enemy', text: "Archie on Toadsworth: Just another bureaucrat trying to hold onto the scraps of a broken system. Pathetic." },
        'captain_toadette': { type: 'enemy', text: "Archie on Toadette: A fanatic. Blind loyalty is even more boring than regular loyalty. At least she's angry." },
        'earl_grey': { type: 'enemy', text: "Archie on Earl Grey: Big guy with an axe. Almost as boring as Humpik, but on the wrong side." },
        'lario': { type: 'ally', text: "Archie on Lario: The little goblin actually pulled it off! A logbook... could be useful. Maybe he's not entirely useless after all." },
        'internet_federation': { type: 'enemy', text: "Archie on The Internet Federation: More boring 'order' in a shiny new package. All their rules and protocols are just begging to be broken. A new playground!" },
        'hacktivist_collectives': { type: 'ally', text: "Archie on The Hacktivist Collectives: Finally, some people who get it! Information freedom, chaos, disrupting the system... they're artists! My kind of people." },
        'bryan': { type: 'enemy', text: "Archie on Bryan: Another ghost from the past. He thinks I left him for dead? Please. In my line of work, people get left. He should have been faster. Now he's just another problem to solve." }
    },
    'markop': {
        'archie': { type: 'ally', text: "Markop on Archie: He has caused a tragedy. His pursuit of power, his disregard for the warnings about the staff... it led to the deaths of 13 innocents. I cannot call him an ally. He is a force of chaos I have failed to contain, and that is a stain on my honor." },
        'humpik': { type: 'ally', text: "Markop on Humpik: His loyalty is commendable, though his king is questionable. A strong arm in a just fight. A true friend." },
        'bowser': { type: 'enemy', text: "Markop on Bowser: A tyrant and a warlord. His goals are antithetical to justice and order. An alliance of desperation, not trust." },
        'remi': { type: 'ally', text: "Markop on Remi: Another soul caught in this chaos. I'll have to keep an eye on her, make sure Archie doesn't lead her down the wrong path." },
        'dan': { type: 'enemy', text: "Markop on 'Dan': He is an impostor. Lario's warning cannot be ignored. His actions in the prison—locking us in, his erratic behavior—he is a danger to us all. I failed to see it. I must uncover his true purpose before he leads us all to ruin." },
        'toad_lee': { type: 'ally', text: "Markop on Toad Lee: A steadfast warrior. His dedication to protecting the others is admirable. He is the rock upon which their safety is built." },
        'eager': { type: 'ally', text: "Markop on Eager: His speed is an asset, but he must learn to master his fear. Courage is not the absence of fear, but acting in spite of it." },
        'roger': { type: 'ally', text: "Markop on Roger: His methods are... direct. A firearm is not an honorable weapon, but in these times, survival often outweighs tradition. He is a capable protector." },
        'ryan': { type: 'ally', text: "Markop on Ryan: He has a gift. I hope he learns to wield it with wisdom and restraint, for magic is a powerful but dangerous tool." },
        'bones': { type: 'ally', text: "Markop on Bones: He has endured much. His cynicism is a scar, a shield against a world that has been cruel. But there is strength in him yet." },
        'emperor_elagabalus': { type: 'enemy', text: "Markop on Elagabalus: His Imperial 'peace' is a gilded cage built on the backs of the oppressed. True order comes from justice, not force." },
        'iron_legion': { type: 'enemy', text: "Markop on the Iron Legion: Incompetent, deceptive, and cruel. They tortured Eager, lied about the 'dragon' in the sewer, and used one of their own spies to lead us into a trap. They are not an army of order; they are a gang of thugs with better uniforms." },
        'lord_crimson': { type: 'enemy', text: "Markop on Lord Crimson: An ancient evil that plays with mortals as if they were pawns. He represents a corruption that must be cleansed." },
        'archmage_theron': { type: 'enemy', text: "Markop on Theron: He seeks to cage a storm. Magic is a part of the world, and his fear of its misuse only creates the very monsters he dreads." },
        'chief_thornpaw': { type: 'ally', text: "Markop on Thornpaw: A wise and honorable leader. He understands the balance of the world in a way the 'civilized' rulers do not." },
        'high_inquisitor_vale': { type: 'enemy', text: "Markop on Vale: He has twisted the faith I once held into a weapon of blind hatred. He is a cautionary tale, a mirror of what I could have become." },
        'captain_syrup': { type: 'enemy', text: "Markop on Syrup: A pirate who lives by no code but her own greed. She is a symptom of the lawlessness we must fight." },
        'chancellor_toadsworth': { type: 'ally', text: "Markop on Toadsworth: A good man trying to hold his world together in a time of crisis. He has my sympathies, and my aid if he should ask it." },
        'captain_toadette': { type: 'enemy', text: "Markop on Toadette: Her loyalty is admirable, but it has become a blinding fanaticism. She cannot see that her actions are creating more chaos, not less." },
        'lario': { type: 'ally', text: "Markop on Lario: He stole a logbook. While theft is dishonorable, if it contains a clue to Eager's whereabouts... it is a necessary evil. A tool we must use." }
    },
    'humpik': {
        'bowser': { type: 'ally', text: "Humpik on Bowser: King Bowser is my friend. We fight together now. It is good." },
        'archie': { type: 'ally', text: "Humpik on Archie: The little guy is crazy! But he makes big explosions! Good to have in a scrap." },
        'markop': { type: 'ally', text: "Humpik on Markop: The horse-man is too serious. But he fights good. I respect that. He and the little guy argue a lot now. About the other little guy. Weird." },
        'remi': { type: 'ally', text: "Humpik on Remi: New girl. Looks small. Hope she can fight." },
        'waluigi': { type: 'ally', text: "Humpik on Waluigi: The skinny purple man... he grew wings! And saved me! He is strange, but he is a friend. A good friend. I owe him." },
        'iron_thorn': { type: 'enemy', text: "Humpik on Iron Thorn: Metal man hurt my friend! I hit him with my axe! If I see him again, I will hit him harder!" },
        'dan': { type: 'ally', text: "Humpik on Dan: The little toad is hurt bad. The metal men took his arm. I will get this... ozo-thing... to help him. I will not fail." },
        'toad_lee': { type: 'ally', text: "Humpik on Toad Lee: He has a big axe! He fights good! GWAHAHA!" },
        'eager': { type: 'ally', text: "Humpik on Eager: He's fast! Hard to hit! Good!" },
        'roger': { type: 'ally', text: "Humpik on Roger: He has a boom-stick! Loud! Good for fighting!" },
        'ryan': { type: 'ally', text: "Humpik on Ryan: He does the sparkly stuff. Weird, but can be strong." },
        'bones': { type: 'ally', text: "Humpik on Bones: He looks like he's been in a lot of fights. He's a tough little guy." },
        'black_t': { type: 'neutral', text: "Humpik on Black T: Small toad in black. Talked about toad selling. He was hiding. Strange."},
        'iron_legion': { type: 'ally', text: "Humpik on Iron Legion Secret Service: The quiet metal men took me to Dan. They are helping. They are... useful."}
    },
    'bowser': {
        'archie': { type: 'ally', text: "Bowser on Archie: This three-eyed menace is more trouble than he's worth! His chaotic schemes almost got us all captured or killed. He's on thin ice." },
        'markop': { type: 'ally', text: "Bowser on Markop: The horse-man has honor, which is a weakness. But he's a strong fighter. He keeps the little guys in line, so he's useful for now." },
        'humpik': { type: 'ally', text: "Bowser on Humpik: My most loyal ally! He has the strength of a mountain and the loyalty of a true friend! GWAHAHAHA!" },
        'remi': { type: 'ally', text: "Bowser on Remi: Another minion. As long as she follows orders, I don't care who she is." },
        'waluigi': { type: 'neutral', text: "Bowser on Waluigi: The purple string bean? He's a schemer. Useful for now, but not to be trusted. He got Humpik out, so... credit where it's due." },
        'dan': { type: 'enemy', text: "Bowser on Dan: The little hero toad is broken. Pathetic. Loyalty that leads to losing an arm is a poor investment. Still, he fought well before. Maybe he can be reforged into something useful." },
        'toad_lee': { type: 'ally', text: "Bowser on Toad Lee: He holds the powerful staff. A strong minion with a strong weapon. Good. He understands that power is what matters." },
        'eager': { type: 'enemy', text: "Bowser on Eager: My best warriors are wading through sewers for this little morsel? He'd better be worth the trouble. A king doesn't waste resources on insignificant pawns. This rescue is a distraction from my glorious conquest!" },
        'roger': { type: 'ally', text: "Bowser on Roger: The one with the gun. Smart. Guns are good for making problems go away. He understands practicality. A useful kind of minion." },
        'ryan': { type: 'neutral', text: "Bowser on Ryan: The quiet one with the magic? Kamek says he's a snake. A 'warden'. Good. Deception is a tool of the powerful. We'll see if he's any good at it." },
        'bones': { type: 'ally', text: "Bowser on Bones: He looks like he's been through a real fight. Ugly, but tough. I respect that. Toughness is good." }
    },
    'remi': {
        'archie': { type: 'neutral', text: "Remi on Archie: This guy is chaos incarnate. He got me involved in a murder plot within minutes of meeting him. He's terrifying, but... you can't deny he gets results. I'm staying on his good side." },
        'markop': { type: 'ally', text: "Remi on Markop: The Centaur. He seems honorable, a calm center in this storm. He's the complete opposite of Archie, which is probably a good thing. I feel safer when he's around." },
        'humpik': { type: 'ally', text: "Remi on Humpik: He's... loud. But he seems loyal to his friends. Stood up for me against the Iron Legion. I think he's a good person under all that shouting and armor." },
        'bowser': { type: 'enemy', text: "Remi on Bowser: He knew the box was a bomb and just... watched. He's a monster. A king of monsters. I don't trust him for a second, even if we're on the same side for now." },
        'dan': { type: 'ally', text: "Remi on Dan: Everyone calls him a hero, but he seems broken now. It's a heavy burden to carry, being the 'hope' of your people. Especially when you're just a kid." },
        'toad_lee': { type: 'ally', text: "Remi on Toad Lee: He's quiet, but he's holding that crazy staff. It feels like he's carrying the weight of the world on his shoulders. Respectable, in a terrifying way." },
        'eager': { type: 'ally', text: "Remi on Eager: He's been through a lot. Captured, tortured, captured again... now he's with us in this sewer. He's scared, but he's still going. That's brave." },
        'roger': { type: 'ally', text: "Remi on Roger: The pragmatic one. He's got his head on straight. In this crew, someone needs to." },
        'ryan': { type: 'neutral', text: "Remi on Ryan: The quiet magic user. Seems harmless enough, but there's something... off about him. He's too watchful." },
        'bones': { type: 'ally', text: "Remi on Bones: Looks like he's seen things. He's cynical, but he's a survivor. You can trust a survivor to watch their own back, and maybe yours if it helps them." }

        'archie': { type: 'ally', text: "Waluigi on Archie: WAH! A true artist of chaos! He understands the beauty of a well-placed explosion! A worthy apprentice!" },

        'bowser': { type: 'neutral', text: "Waluigi on Bowser: Another big, angry brute who wants to rule everything. So unoriginal! But his army is a useful distraction." },
        'lario': { type: 'ally', text: "Waluigi on Lario: WAH! The little goblin shows up everywhere! He's like a bad smell you can't get rid of. But he knows things... useful things. He's more interesting than I thought!" },
        'lady_toriel': { type: 'ally', text: "Waluigi on Lady Toriel: WAH! She's so polite! It's weird! But she knows everyone. A useful, fluffy tool for my magnificent plans!" }

    'wario': {
        'waluigi': { type: 'ally', text: "Mr. Wario on Waluigi: He is chaos. Unpredictable. This makes him a useful tool and a dangerous liability. For now, the potential profit outweighs the risk. His... style... provides excellent cover for my own, more discreet operations." },
        'lady_toriel': { type: 'ally', text: "Mr. Wario on Lady Toriel: She has influence and coin. A valuable contact. The dinner was a worthwhile expense to secure access to her province's resources and political capital. A pragmatic and useful partner." },
        'regal_empire': { type: 'enemy', text: "Mr. Wario on The Regal Empire: Bad for business. Their obsession with 'order' involves too many regulations, taxes, and patrols. Their stability is the stability of a stagnant pond. There's more profit in a hurricane."}
    },
    'lady_toriel': {
        'waluigi': { type: 'neutral', text: "Lady Toriel on Waluigi: A most... spirited individual. His energy is certainly... unique. The dinner was quite an experience." },

        'xo_staff': { type: 'enemy', text: "Dan on X.O.'s Staff: It whispered to me. It promised me the strength to protect everyone. But it lied. It's a corrupting thing, a weapon of sorrow. I never want to touch it again." }
