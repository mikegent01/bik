        `Foreword:\n\nThese are not rules. They are suggestions for a better, more interesting reality. Laws are for the predictable. Edicts are for the boring. The Punchline is for everyone. Read on, and learn to laugh at the collapsing architecture of causality.`,
        `Political Law: The Rule of Random\n\nAll decisions are made by rolling dice with pictures on them instead of numbers. The outcome is considered the will of the Cosmic Jester. If the dice roll off the table, the decision is postponed in favor of a mandatory snack break.`,
        `Social Law: The Law of WAH!\n\nGreetings, farewells, declarations of war, and requests to pass the salt must all be accompanied by a triumphant 'WAH!'. Failure to do so is not a crime, but it is deeply unfashionable. Style is the only true social contract.`,
        `Economic Law: The Currency of Confusion\n\nOfficial currency is not recognized. All trade is to be conducted via barter. An ideal transaction is one where both parties leave convinced they got the better deal, but are unsure what they actually traded. Mismatched socks are considered a highly stable commodity.`,
        `Penal Law: Trial by Pratfall\n\nThere are no crimes, only bad performances. 'Criminals' are not imprisoned, but are sentenced to perform a public, embarrassing pratfall. The severity of the sentence is determined by the laughter of the crowd. A truly spectacular failure is celebrated as a work of art.`
