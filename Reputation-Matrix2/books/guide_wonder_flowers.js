    pages: [
        `By a very confused botanist:\n\nThis guide is an attempt to catalogue the bizarre and reality-bending flora of the Flower Kingdom. Standard botanical classification has proven... inadequate.`,
        `The Talking Flower:\n\n- Appearance: A standard-looking flower, but with a mouth.\n- Effect: It talks. Incessantly. It offers encouragement, bad advice, and sometimes existential dread. Do not listen to it for too long.`,
        `The Pipe-Sprouting Petunia:\n\n- Appearance: A vibrant petunia.\n- Effect: When touched, causes green Warp Pipes to sprout from the ground, often in inconvenient locations, such as the middle of a dinner table.`,
        `The Stampede Daisy:\n\n- Appearance: An innocent-looking daisy.\n- Effect: When approached, summons a stampede of startled, glowing buffalo-like creatures from a pocket dimension. It is advised to admire this one from a distance.`,
        `Conclusion:\n\nMy research has led me to a single, inescapable conclusion: the flora of the Flower Kingdom operates on the principles of pure, unadulterated nonsense. I am retiring to a quiet farm in the Midlands where the plants, for the most part, obey the laws of physics.`
