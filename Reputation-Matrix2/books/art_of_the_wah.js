        `...from the Introduction, allegedly penned by 'The True Master of Mischief'.\n\nFools speak of good and evil. I speak of style. A villain who simply conquers is a brute. A villain who does so with a magnificent, twirling mustache and a triumphant 'WAH!'... that is an artist. This tome is not about the 'why' of villainy, but the 'how'. How to be spectacular. How to be unforgettable. How to be... Waluigi.`,
        `...from Chapter 1: The Importance of the Entrance.\n\nNever simply walk into a room. Emerge. Explode from a trap door. Descend from the ceiling on a gilded wire. Arrive on the back of a poorly-trained but enthusiastic velociraptor. Your arrival must be an event, a moment of such baffling spectacle that your enemies are defeated by sheer confusion before the first blow is even thrown.`,
        `...from Chapter 3: The Monologue.\n\nA good monologue is not about revealing your plan. It is about wasting their time. While you are explaining your brilliant, overly-complex scheme, your minions are busy tying their shoelaces together. The monologue is a weapon of temporal warfare.`,
        `...from the Epilogue: The Exit.\n\nNever be captured. Simply... exit. A puff of purple smoke. A well-timed escape balloon shaped like your own magnificent head. An absurdly complex series of tunnels that you dug yourself. A true artist knows when the show is over.`
