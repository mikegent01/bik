    title: "A Study of Wario's Greed: A Psychological Profile",
    pages: [
        `By Detective Penny, DCI\n\nSubject: Wario. Diagnosis: Pathological Avarice.\n\nThe subject's entire psychological makeup appears to revolve around the acquisition of wealth. This is not simple greed; it is a compulsive, all-consuming need. He does not seek wealth for the comfort it provides, but for the sake of having it.`,
        `Analysis of Motives:\n\nIt is my professional opinion that Wario's greed is a compensatory mechanism. He is a grotesque parody of the kingdom's heroes, and his obsession with treasure is a way to measure his self-worth. Each coin is a victory, each stolen gem a trophy that proves he is better than those who look down on him.`,
        `Tactical Weaknesses:\n\nThis obsession is also his greatest weakness. He can be baited with the promise of a sufficiently large treasure. He can be distracted by a single, shiny coin. His jealousy of those with more wealth than him is a powerful lever that can be used to manipulate him. He is predictable in his avarice.`,
        `Conclusion:\n\nTo defeat Wario, one must not fight his strength, but his greed. The best way to catch this particular dragon is to build a bigger pile of gold.`
