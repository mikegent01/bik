        `Introduction:\n\nThe School of Abjuration is the least flashy, but the most vital, of all the arcane arts. The Evoker seeks to create fire; the Abjurer seeks to not be burned by it. The Illusionist creates a phantom sword; the Abjurer's shield proves it to be false. We are the school of protection, of wards, and of denial.`,
        `Chapter 1: The Basic Shield Cantrip\n\nThe Shield spell is the cornerstone of our art. It is a simple projection of pure force, a temporary hardening of reality itself. A novice creates a wall. A master creates a second skin, one that moves and reacts, deflecting a blow before it even lands.`,
        `Chapter 4: Warding Theory\n\nA ward is a spell of waiting. It is a knot tied in the fabric of reality, designed to trigger upon a specific condition. A simple ward might be a magical alarm. A complex one can banish a specific type of creature, silence all sound in a room, or redirect a hostile spell back at its caster.`,
        `A Note from the Conservators:\n\nRemember, the best abjuration is one that is never tested. The goal is not to win the fight, but to prevent it from ever happening. The perfect ward is a deterrent so powerful that no one dares to breach it. This is the true meaning of magical order.`
