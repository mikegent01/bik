        `...from Chapter 1: The Philosophy of Silence.\n\nThe Empire is a body, and we are its immune system. We move unseen, we fight in shadow, and we cut out the cancers of chaos and sedition before they can fester. The common man does not need to know of our work. His peace is our reward. To be unknown is to be successful. To be unthanked is the highest honor.`,
        `...from Chapter 4: Basic Ciphers (Redacted).\n\n- The Shift Cipher: A rudimentary but effective field cipher. Each letter is shifted forward in the alphabet by a pre-determined key number. For added security, the key is often the number of stars visible in the [REDACTED] constellation on the day the message is sent.`,
        `...from Chapter 7: Asset Identification.\n\nAn asset can be anyone. The disgruntled servant, the greedy merchant, the ambitious noble. Everyone has a lever: be it coin, fear, or ideology. A good agent does not use their own strength, but learns to pull the levers that already exist in the world. Identify the lever, and you can move anything, or anyone.`,
        `...from Appendix C: Known Threats (Redacted).\n\n- The Freelancer Underworld: A chaotic network of criminals. Too disorganized to be a true threat, but their information brokers are a valuable source of... [REDACTED].\n- The Unchained: Idealistic fools. Their message of freedom is a dangerous infection, but their lack of central command makes them predictable. Target their symbols.`,
