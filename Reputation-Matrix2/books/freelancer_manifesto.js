        `By: The Broker (Allegedly)\n\nKings have crowns. Guilds have rules. We have contracts. That is the fundamental difference. Do not mistake our lack of a flag for a lack of power. Our power is liquid, flowing where the coin is best.`,
        `Rule 1: Loyalty is a Liability.\n\nDo not swear fealty to a king who will send you to die for a piece of land. Do not swear an oath to a guild that will demand you share your profits. Your only loyalty is to the contract. And to yourself.`,
        `Rule 2: Information is Worth More Than Gold.\n\nGold can be stolen. Information can be sold a thousand times and still be yours. The whisper in the right ear is more powerful than the sharpest blade. Know everything. Sell what is useful. Keep what is dangerous.`,
        `Rule 3: Everyone Has a Price.\n\nEveryone. The noble paladin, the ruthless tyrant, the pious priest. It is not always coin. Sometimes it is power. Sometimes it is a secret. Your job is to find the price, and then decide if you can afford to pay it, or make them pay yours.`
