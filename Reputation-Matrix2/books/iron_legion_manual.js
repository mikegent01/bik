        `...from the Introduction by General Marcus Ironhand.\n\nThis manual is your life. The Hammer Code within these pages is your soul. Read it. Memorize it. Obey it. The Legion is a single, perfect war machine. You are but one component. Do not fail your part.`,
        `...from Section 2: The Hammer Code.\n\n- An order is not a suggestion. It is a fact.\n- A defense is a temporary measure before an attack.\n- A Legionnaire's life belongs to the Emperor. Spend it wisely.\n- Chaos is the enemy. Order is the only virtue.`,
        `...from Section 6: Siege Tactics.\n\nThe Legion does not raid. We conquer. A siege is a methodical, relentless application of pressure. We build our fortifications, we bring up our Forge Engines, and we grind the enemy down. We do not rush. We do not tire. We are inevitable.`,
        `...from Section 11: Protocol in Occupied Territories.\n\nThe conquered peoples are not our equals. They are the raw material from which a new, orderly province will be forged. Enforce the law without passion. Suppress dissent without mercy. They do not need to love us. They only need to obey.`
