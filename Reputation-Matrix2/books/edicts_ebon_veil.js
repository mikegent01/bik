        `By order of the Shadow Patriarch, Lady Ebonveil:\n\nEdict 1: The Masquerade is Absolute. Our existence is a secret to be guarded with your unlife. Do not reveal your true nature to mortals unless it serves the Grand Design. A breach of the Masquerade will be met with a final, true death.`,
        `Edict 3: The Gift is a Tool, Not a Toy. Your powers are not for wanton cruelty or petty games. Every use must serve a purpose, be it the acquisition of knowledge, the elimination of a threat, or the subtle turning of a political tide. Wastefulness is a mortal flaw.`,
        `Edict 7: The Rabid Dogs Must Be Kept on a Leash. The werewolves of the Moonfang Pack are a nuisance. Do not engage them in open conflict unless necessary. It is messy and draws unwanted attention. Let them howl in their forests. We will win the war in the drawing rooms and bedchambers of their mortal allies.`
