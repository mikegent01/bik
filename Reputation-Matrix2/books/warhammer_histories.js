        `...from the introduction by a condemned Imperial Scholar.\n\nLet the reader understand: our world is not the center of a peaceful cosmos. It is a fragile bauble, a mote of light adrift on an endless sea of raw, seething Chaos. From this sea, the Great Powers reach out, offering gifts of power to mortals in exchange for their souls. To know them is to risk damnation, but to ignore them is to guarantee it.`,
        `...on The Empire and its Foes.\n\nThe Empire of Man is a bulwark against the darkness, but it is a dam with a thousand cracks. From the north, the Chaos-worshipping tribes pour south, seeking to end the world. From the mountains, the endless tide of Greenskins rises, seeking only battle and ruin. And from within, the taint of the undead stirs in cursed Sylvania, and the insidious Skaven plot in their tunnels below.`,
        `...on Sigmar, The Founder.\n\nLong ago, the tribes of men were scattered and weak. It was Sigmar, a warrior of unparalleled might, who united them. He drove the Greenskins from the lands, forged an unbreakable alliance with the Dwarfs, and was crowned the first Emperor. Upon his death, he ascended to become the patron god of the Empire. He is a symbol of unity, strength, and the eternal war against the darkness.`,
        `...a final warning.\n\nDo not seek this knowledge. Do not speak the names of the Dark Gods. The agents of the Sigmarite cult and the Witch Hunters are ever-watchful. To merely possess this book is a death sentence. Burn it. And pray Sigmar has mercy on your soul.`
