        `A Koopa Navy Intelligence Report:\n\nThis volume details the crude but effective naval vessels of the Kremling Krew. While lacking the magical sophistication of our own fleet, their ships are brutally pragmatic and heavily armed.`,
        `Class: Gangplank Galleon\n\nThis appears to be K. Rool's flagship. It is a massive, heavily-armed galleon, but its construction is shoddy. Reports indicate it is prone to sinking, catching fire, and being boarded by angry apes. Tactical weakness: its main weak point seems to be the big, obvious 'K' on the sail.`,
        `Class: Krocodile Kore (Submarine)\n\nA submersible vessel shaped like a giant crocodile. Its primary weapon is a powerful laser fired from its mouth. Its primary weakness appears to be a severe design flaw that causes it to surface directly underneath Donkey Kong's fist.`,
        `Conclusion:\n\nKremling naval strategy seems to rely on overwhelming numbers and cartoonish villainy rather than sound engineering. They are a threat, but a predictable one. Their constant obsession with bananas is a logistical weakness that can be exploited.`
