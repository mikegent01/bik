        `As told by Cranky Kong:\n\nBack in my day, we didn't have all these fancy 'factions' and 'politics'. We had crocodiles, and they wanted our bananas. Simple as that. This is the story of the Great Banana War.`,
        `Chapter 1: The First Theft\n\nIt all started with King K. Rool. Big, bloated lizard with a crown too small for his head. He and his Kremling Krew snuck onto our island in the dead of night and stole the whole hoard! Every last banana! Donkey Kong was furious. I told him, 'See? This is what happens when you leave the front door unlocked.'`,
        `Chapter 3: The Battle of Gangplank Galleon\n\nWe tracked them back to their rusty excuse for a ship. It was a proper brawl! We threw barrels! They threw cannonballs! I hit K. Rool so hard he flew all the way to the moon! Or was that a different time? My memory's not what it used to be.`,
        `Conclusion:\n\nWe got the bananas back, of course. We always do. The Kremlings never learn. They'll be back, and we'll be ready. Now get off my lawn.`
