        `So, you have been invited to a soiree at a vampire's manor? Congratulations! And condolences. To ensure you survive the evening with your throat intact, please observe the following rules.`,
        `1. On Compliments: Do not comment on their pale complexion. Instead, compliment their exquisite taste in art, their ancient tapestries, or their surprisingly well-preserved furniture.`,
        `2. On Dining: Do not ask what is in the wine. It is wine. You will not be offered any.`,
        `3. On Conversation: Avoid the topic of sunlight. Or garlic. Or pointy wooden objects. Instead, discuss history, philosophy, or the amusingly fleeting nature of mortal politics. They enjoy that.`,
        `4. On Parting: If a vampire tells you that you have 'a lovely neck,' this is a high compliment. Thank them, and then leave. Immediately.`
