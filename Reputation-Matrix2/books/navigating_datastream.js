        `...from the Introduction for Tourists.\n\nWelcome to The Internet! A dimension of pure information, where thoughts are things and data flows in great, shimmering rivers. This guide will help you navigate the main data-streams and avoid the darker, un-indexed currents where... things... lurk.`,
        `...from Chapter 2: Major Hubs.\n\n- The Oracle's Spire (Google): The center of all indexed knowledge. If it's on the Surface Web, the Oracle knows it.\n- The Great Social Forum (Facebook): A chaotic, continent-sized metropolis. A good place to find old friends, and to get into arguments with strangers about politics.\n- The Knowledge Garden (Wikipedia): A peaceful, user-curated encyclopedia. Be warned: editing wars can be surprisingly vicious.`,
        `...from Chapter 5: Local Slang.\n\n- 'Flame War': A pointless, angry argument that generates more heat than light.\n- 'Troll': A native entity that feeds on anger and attention. Do not feed the trolls.\n- 'Meme': An infectious idea. Can range from a simple joke to a complex, reality-bending concept. Some are dangerous.`,
        `...from the Warning Section.\n\nDo not attempt to enter the 'Deep Web' without a certified guide. The Federation cannot guarantee your safety in un-indexed domains. The firewall is there for your own protection. Happy surfing!`
