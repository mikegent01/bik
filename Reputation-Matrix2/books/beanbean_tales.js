        `The Tale of the Chuckola Fruit:\n\nLong ago, the great god Chuckle-Heimer was so amused by the antics of the first Beanish people that he laughed for a hundred years. His laughter fell to the earth as golden fruit, and those who ate it were filled with his joy and good humor. This is why all Beanish people have such a great sense of humor. (Except for Prince Peasley. He's a bit stuffy.)`,
        `The Tale of Hoohoo Mountain:\n\nThe great Hoohoo Mountain was not always stone. It was once a giant, grumpy cloud who refused to rain. The people below grew thirsty, so they told the cloud the funniest joke in the world. The cloud laughed so hard it turned to stone, and its tears of laughter became the waterfall that flows to this day.`,
        `The Tale of the Grinning Totems:\n\nThey say that if you tell a good joke to the strange, grinning totems in Teehee Valley, they will point you to a hidden treasure. But if you tell a bad joke, they will swallow you whole. It is a tough crowd.`
