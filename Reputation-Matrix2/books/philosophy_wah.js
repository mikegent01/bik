        `By Waluigi\n\nIs it a cry of victory? A lament of defeat? A greeting? A question? The answer is YES. The 'WAH' is not a word. It is an expression of the soul's purest state: magnificent, self-assured chaos.`,
        `The world is divided into two types of people: those who 'WAH', and those who do not. Those who do not are the boring ones. The rule-followers. The predictable ones. They build their neat little castles of order, and they are terrified when someone like me shows up to rearrange the furniture.`,
        `To truly understand the 'WAH', you must embrace the inverted L. It is a symbol of defiance. It says, 'I will not be a cornerstone. I will be the one piece that doesn't fit, the one that makes the whole perfect, boring puzzle fall apart.' To be the L is to be yourself, in all your lanky, purple, magnificent glory.`,
        `So go forth. Be the agent of your own magnificent chaos. And when in doubt, just remember one simple, profound truth: WAH!`
