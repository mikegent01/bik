        `Edict I: Order is the Anvil\n\nChaos is the raw, unformed metal. It is ugly, useless, and dangerous. The Legion is the hammer. Our purpose is to beat the chaos of the world into the shape of order upon the anvil of Imperial law. This is not conquest; it is creation.`,
        `Edict III: The Chain of Command is Unbreakable\n\nTo question an order is to invite chaos into the ranks. A Legionnaire's faith in his Centurion must be absolute. The Centurion's faith in his Tribune, the Tribune's in his Hammer Lord. This chain, forged in loyalty, is our greatest strength. A single weak link will be reforged or discarded.`,
        `Edict V: A Fortress is a Promise in Stone\n\nWhere the Legion marches, it builds. A fortress is not merely a defense; it is a promise of enduring order. It tells the conquered that we are not leaving. It tells the wilderness that it has been tamed. It is a symbol of our will made manifest.`,
        `Edict IX: The Price of Peace is Eternal Vigilance\n\nThere is no final victory. There is only the long, slow, and brutal work of maintaining order. The moment we rest, chaos seeps back in. The hammer must never stop falling.`
