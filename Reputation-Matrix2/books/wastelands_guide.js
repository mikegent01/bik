        `Tip #1: Water is Life. Treasure is Better.\n\nSure, you need water to live. But a big pile of gold can buy you a lot of water. And better minions to carry it for you. Always prioritize the loot.`,
        `Tip #4: If It's Shiny, It's Probably Valuable or a Trap.\n\nUse a long stick to poke shiny things from a distance. If it explodes, it was a trap. If it doesn't, it's valuable. The stick is a valuable tool.`,
        `Tip #9: Making Friends.\n\n'Friends' are people who haven't tried to steal your stuff yet. The best way to make friends is to have a bigger gun than everyone else.`,
        `Tip #17: That Giant Sand Worm.\n\nDon't fight it. Just... don't. Run away. Let someone else deal with it. Then come back later and loot their corpse. Efficiency.`
