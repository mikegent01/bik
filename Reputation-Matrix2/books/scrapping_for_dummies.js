        `A Note from Ratchet Raiders Press:\n\nSo, your local neighborhood superpower had another big, flashy fight and left a bunch of smoking metal all over the place? Don't let that perfectly good scrap go to waste! This guide will teach you, the average Joe, how to turn that battlefield trash into treasure!`,
        `Chapter 1: Is It Gonna Go 'Boom'?\n\nFirst rule of scrapping: identify the explodey bits. See that little round thing with the wind-up key? That's a Bob-omb. Don't touch it. See that giant bullet with the angry face? That's a Banzai Bill. Definitely don't touch that. That little green mushroom? Also probably a bomb. It's best to assume everything is a bomb until proven otherwise.`,
        `Chapter 3: Imperial vs. Koopa Wiring\n\nThis is a classic rookie mistake. Imperial tech uses neat, color-coded wires. Red is usually power, blue is usually data. Simple! Koopa tech, on the other hand, seems to be wired with whatever Kamek had lying around. All the wires are grey, and they're all covered in some kind of sticky jam. Good luck.`,
        `Chapter 6: How to Not Lose a Finger to a Live Capacitor\n\nThat big, shiny cylinder in the middle of most magitek engines? That's a capacitor. It holds a lot of... angry lightning. Before you try to remove it, poke it with a long, metal stick. From a safe distance. If the stick turns to ash and your hair stands on end, wait a few more minutes before trying again.`
