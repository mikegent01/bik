        `Case File: 734-Alpha. Subject designation: 'Kirby'.\n\nNature of Entity: Unknown. Appears as a small, pink, spherical being of immense power and appetite. Origin is extra-dimensional.`,
        `Initial Observation:\n\nSubject appeared in a flash of pink light in the Mages' Guild's main refectory during lunch. It proceeded to inhale the entire buffet, three tables, and a junior apprentice named Bartholomew. Bartholomew was later expelled, unharmed but covered in some kind of sweet, sticky residue.`,
        `Power Analysis:\n\nThe subject's primary ability is inhalation, allowing it to consume objects many times its own size. Upon consuming a magical being or object, it appears to copy its primary ability. After consuming a fire elemental, the subject was observed to breathe a jet of flame hot enough to melt stone. After consuming a hat, it became more stylish.`,
        `Conclusion by Archmage Theron:\n\nThis entity represents the single greatest threat of uncontrolled, chaotic magic we have ever encountered. Its very existence is a violation of the laws of physics, thermodynamics, and basic table manners. All attempts to contain it failed. It eventually wandered off, chasing a butterfly. If sighted, do not engage. Do not make eye contact. And for the love of the stars, hide your lunch.`
