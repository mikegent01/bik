        `To join our ranks is to swear an oath to the Code. To prove you are worthy of that oath, all initiates must pass the Three Trials.`,
        `The Trial of the Hunt:\n\nYou will be given a bounty contract for a dangerous but non-sentient beast. You must track it, subdue it, and return it to the Guildhall. This tests your skill, your patience, and your ability to follow a contract to the letter.`,
        `The Trial of the Law:\n\nYou will be placed in a simulated scenario where you must capture a target in a crowded city without harming any civilians or breaking any local laws. This tests your discretion and your respect for the order we serve.`,
        `The Trial of the Heart:\n\nYou will be given a contract for a target who is morally ambiguousâ€”a thief who steals to feed the poor, a deserter who fled an unjust war. You must bring them in. This tests your professionalism, your ability to place the Code above your personal feelings. If you cannot, you are not worthy to wear the Blade.`
