        `(A page with a crude, angry drawing of Bowser)\n\nI HAVE FURY! The beef-head turtle thinks he has the ownership of this castle? This castle of peaches? WRONG! It is a castle of FURY! My fury! He is a king of failure who is now a footnote in my magnificent biography of WINNING!`,
        `(A schematic for a 'Doom-Vac' is doodled next to a list)\n\nEnemies of Fawful:\n1. The Red Mustache Man (annoying!)\n2. The Green Mustache Man (a sidekick of annoyance!)\n3. The Beanish Prince who has the dumbness.\n4. All peoples who lack the appreciation of my genius!\n5. CHUCKOLA COLA! FIZZ OF MY NIGHTMARES!`,
        `(The handwriting gets progressively larger and angrier)\n\nMY MINIONS ARE FOOLS! They cannot even polish my brain-helmet without leaving the smudges of their incompetence! I need minions with more FURY! More CHORTLES! I will build them! I will build a minion of PURE FURY who laughs at all my jokes! YES!`,
        `I HAVE CHORTLES! This diary-keeping is a stress reliever! It is like a punching bag for my feelings, but with more words and less satisfying impact! Perhaps I will add a punching bag to my diary. A 'Punch-Diary'! YES! GENIUS!`
