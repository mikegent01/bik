    pages: [
        `Introduction:\n\nMost see our homes as simple, whimsical mushrooms. But the art of Myco-Architecture is a complex and ancient one. We do not build our homes; we cultivate them. We guide the growth of the great fungi, shaping them over decades into the dwellings you see today. It is a partnership with nature, not a conquest of it.`,
        `Chapter 2: The Living Wall\n\nThe walls of a Toadstool home are alive. They are a semi-porous membrane that breathes, filtering the air and maintaining a constant, pleasant internal temperature. The vibrant colors of our homes are not paint, but the natural pigmentation of the fungal species, chosen for both its beauty and its resilience.`,
        `Chapter 5: The Root-Cellar\n\nThe 'basement' of a Toadstool home is, in fact, part of the vast, interconnected mycelial network that runs beneath the entire kingdom. This allows for a natural form of communication and resource sharing between homes. It is also why a blight in one home can quickly spread to an entire neighborhood if not properly contained.`
