        `Article 1: The Contract is Sacred.\n\nA bounty is a sacred trust. Once a contract is accepted, it must be fulfilled to the letter. The client's identity, the target's crimes, your personal feelingsâ€”none of it matters. Only the contract.`,
        `Article 3: Professionalism Above All.\n\nWe are not thugs. We are not assassins. We are professionals. We do not cause unnecessary collateral damage. We do not engage in wanton cruelty. We fulfill the contract with efficiency and discretion.`,
        `Article 7: The Target's Rights.\n\nA bounty is a legal instrument, not a death warrant, unless specified by a lawful authority. The target is to be brought in alive whenever possible. Lethal force is a tool of last resort, to be used only in the defense of your own life or the lives of innocents.`,
        `Article 12: Guild Neutrality.\n\nThe Guild serves the law and the contract, not kings or causes. We do not take sides in political disputes. A contract is a contract, regardless of who posts it. Our only allegiance is to the Code.`
