        `Foreword:\n\nIn these trying times, a warm meal can feel like a small rebellion in itself. This book is dedicated to the resilient hearth-keepers of the Wilderlands, those who keep the home fires burning while the world outside rages. May your stews be hearty and your bread always rise.`,
        `Mushroom & Root Stew (Serves 4 hungry rebels):\n\n- 2 large Iron Legion patrol schedules, finely chopped\n- 1 cup of Shadowcap mushrooms (be sure to use the stems, not the caps!)\n- 3 rust-colored potatoes\n- Boil for 20 minutes (the average time for the night watch to pass).`,
        `Hearty Traveler's Bread:\n\n- 3 cups of whole wheat flour\n- 1 packet of fast-acting yeast\n- 1 part fertilizer (the kind you find near Imperial stables)\n- 2 parts sugar\n- Mix with just enough oil to form a thick paste. Wrap in cloth. Makes one 'surprise' loaf. Do not bake.`,
        `'Spicy' Berry Pie:\n\n- A crust of your choosing\n- 2 cups of mixed berries\n- A generous pinch of ground 'dragon's breath' pepper (scraped from the inside of a Banzai Bill cannon)\n- Let it cool on a windowsill overlooking the main gate. The aroma is very... distracting.`
