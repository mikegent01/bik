        `Da Rulez (as told by Skarjaw):\n\nRule One: Da Biggest is da Boss. If ya think you're bigger, have a go. If ya win, you're da new boss. If ya lose, you're a good footstool.\n\nRule Two: A good scrap is better than shiny bitz. But if ya win da scrap, ya get da bitz anyway, so it's a win-win.`,
        `Rule Three: Green is Best. Obviously.\n\nRule Four: 'Kunnin'' is good. 'Brutal' is good. Bein' 'brutally kunnin'' is best. Or maybe 'kunninly brutal'? I'll have a think on that one.`,
        `Rule Five: If it ain't broke, add more spikes and paint it red. Red ones go fasta. Dis is known.`
