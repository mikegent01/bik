        `By King Bowser\n\nConquest is not just about armies and firepower. It is about will. And nothing fuels the will of a Koopa soldier like a good meal! This book contains the recipes that have fueled my army for generations. GWAHAHAHA!`,
        `Spiny Egg Omelette:\n\n- 6 Spiny Eggs (CAREFULLY de-spined)\n- 1 Fire Flower (for heat)\n- A splash of lava from the castle moat\n- Cook until it stops screaming. Serves one hungry king.`,
        `Goomba Goulash:\n\nJust kidding! We don't eat the Goombas. They are loyal, if bite-sized, soldiers. Mostly.`,
        `Roasted Peach Cobbler:\n\n- Find a Princess.\n- Put her in a different castle.\n- While she's distracted, steal all the peaches from her kingdom.\n- Roast them over the fires of your victory.\n- Tastes like... conquest!`
