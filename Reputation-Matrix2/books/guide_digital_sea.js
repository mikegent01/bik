        `Welcome, Traveler!\n\nSo you've decided to visit The Internet! This guide will help you navigate the wonders of the digital realm without getting your data corrupted. Remember: don't click on strange links, always clear your cache, and never, ever read the comments section.`,
        `Sights to See:\n\n- The Oracle's Spire: Have a question? Any question? The Oracle can answer it. The view from the top is breathtaking.\n- The Knowledge Garden: A peaceful, user-curated encyclopedia. A lovely place for a relaxing afternoon of learning.\n- The Streaming Sea: Catch a live performance from one of the web's biggest stars!`,
        `Local Customs:\n\n- Tipping is appreciated, usually in the form of 'likes' or 'upvotes'.\n- Flame wars are a common, if unpleasant, local pastime. It is best not to get involved.\n- The local language is a bizarre and rapidly-evolving dialect of memes. Don't worry if you don't understand it. Nobody does.`,
        `A Warning:\n\nDo not stray from the indexed pathways. The Deep Web is not a tourist destination. It is a dark and dangerous place, and the Federation cannot guarantee your safety there. Stay on the Surface Web and enjoy your visit!`
