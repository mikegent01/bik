        `...from a corrupted data-slate, text flickering.\n\nThe uninitiated fool sees code and magic as separate things. But the true technomancer understands they are the same. Both are systems of logic, of commands and consequences. A spell is just a program that runs on the operating system of reality. And any program can be hacked.`,
        `...on Magical Viruses.\n\nA 'Curse' is a biological virus. A magical virus is far more elegant. A simple 'Polymorph' script, attached to the castle's messaging system, can turn every royal decree into a flock of confused chickens. A 'Silence' subroutine injected into a golem's command crystal can render it a very large, very useless statue.`,
        `...on Bypassing Digital Wards.\n\nAn arcane ward is a firewall. It looks for specific magical signatures. The key is not to break it, but to fool it. Disguise your 'Fireball' spell as a simple 'Light' cantrip. By the time the ward's antivirus program realizes what's happened, the library is already on fire.`,
        `...on Manipulating Information.\n\nThe greatest power is not to destroy, but to alter. A simple tweak to the Imperial payroll database can make a general a traitor and a private a king. A subtle change in a scrying pool's algorithm can show a vision of a false future. Why conquer a kingdom when you can make it conquer itself?`
