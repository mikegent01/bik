Return to the Vigilance

Back aboard the Vigilance, they are met by a gathering of toads, each insisting the heroes join their faction or “mini group.” Dan, under pressure, falters. Amid the clamor, they spot Waluigi hauling away chests of loot. He claims he’s moving the treasure to a mansion, and Bowser is there as well, assisting with Markop’s belongings.

The group follows them to the Raventree Manor — a ruined estate steeped in ominous atmosphere. As they approach, an uneasy feeling overtakes them. Overgrown paths lead them through the decrepit courtyard toward the massive oak-carved doors.

Raventree Manor: The Exploration

Inside, the Foyer (R02) lies in decay: cracked marble floors, filth, and dust drifting in the stale air. Twin staircases loom overhead, framing the ruined chamber.

They press into the Parlor (R15), where they encounter the ghostly figure of Perrius — sipping tea, polite yet eerie, greeting them as though they’ve arrived “fashionably late.” The parlor is wrecked, save for his untouched teacup.

A toad servant arrives with tea, leading Markop to a closet under the pretense of retrieving his clothes. When the door locks, Markop finds himself battling his own animated clothing.

They continue down the Eastern Hallway (R16e): peeling wallpaper, mildew stink, collapsed ceilings, and debris scattered across the carpets. A crumbled dresser hides a note: “Don’t clean the mirrors.” In a ruined closet nearby, a weathered servant’s uniform lies empty — unnervingly so, for no bones rest within.

The Green Room (R19d)

Eventually, Markop selects the Green Room as his quarters. The fallen door stands crookedly in its frame, barely hanging together. Inside, chaos reigns — couches with faded cushions, a shattered armoire, broken desks, and a rug rolled up against the barricade. Sound had clearly been an enemy here — whether to keep something inside, or to keep its noises from escaping.

At first, Markop tries to settle here. But as the silence stretches and the shadows shift in the debris, he realizes he is utterly alone. Uneasy, he leaves the Green Room to find the others.

The Yellow Room (R19e)

Meanwhile, the exploration continues into the Yellow Room — rubble from a collapsed wall spilling across broken furniture. Shattered glass covers the floor, remnants of a mirror. Amid the ruins, a wardrobe hides faded papers: letters of inheritance, fragments of suspicion, and a correspondence to one Kryn.

The Western Hallway (R16w)

Archie and Humpik wander west instead of following Markop. Here the manor is far more dangerous: collapsed floors, open gaps to the levels below, and precarious joists barely supporting their weight. Archie attempts to cross but becomes stuck, dangling awkwardly as debris shifts beneath him.

Unaware of Archie’s plight, Markop — nervous and clutching his friends’ support — continues to tour the upstairs rooms, searching for safety.

The Daughter’s Bedroom (R17)

He stumbles into the Daughter’s Bedroom: a treacherous ruin, floor pitched at a 60-degree angle, all the furniture sliding into a heap of rubble. The eastern wall trembles with every step, ready to give way entirely.

The Reconnection

As Markop explores further, nerves fraying, he finally realizes his mistake: Archie never followed him. Panic rises, and he rushes back into the halls. There, he finds Archie still trapped, pinned between crumbling beams of the western hallway.

The party regroups at last in the mold-ridden, decrepit corridors of the manor — exhausted, wary, and fully aware that Raventree holds secrets far more dangerous than tattered clothes and broken furniture.
