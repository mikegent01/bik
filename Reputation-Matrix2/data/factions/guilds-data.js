Their works include the Iron Citadel, the Cathedral of the Eternal Flame, and countless lesser structures. The guild jealously guards ancient techniques passed down through generations, including methods of working enchanted stone that modern artificers cannot replicate.

In recent years, the Brethren have faced challenges from cheaper labor and magical construction methods, but their reputation for quality remains unmatched.`,

The Weavers operate through a cell structure—no member knows more than a handful of others. Contracts are accepted through dead drops and coded messages. Payment is made in ways that leave no trace.

To attract their attention, one must know the signs. A particular arrangement of coins on a tavern table. A phrase spoken to the right beggar. Those who seek the Weavers without proper introduction often simply... disappear.`,

Recent events have tested them severely. The loss of the Vigilance, the intensifying crackdown, and the passage of the Iron Mandate have all added pressure. Yet they continue to fight, believing that freedom is worth any price.`,

Their Great Forge has burned continuously for nine centuries, fed by volcanic vents deep beneath the Ironroot Mountains. The secrets of dwarven runic smithing are guarded more closely than any nation's military plans.

The Iron Legion's rise troubles the guild deeply. The Legion's 'Gospel of the Cog' ideology views dwarven craft as inefficient compared to standardized machine production. Legion envoys have demanded exclusive contracts—demands the guild has firmly refused.

Individual guild members like hjumpik often travel the surface world, both to practice their craft and to gather intelligence on potential threats to dwarven interests. The guild maintains strict neutrality, but that neutrality is tested when customers threaten dwarven traditions.`,

For centuries, the Order hunted vampires, werewolves, and demons. Their Templars were welcomed in most lands as protectors against the things that lurk in darkness. The Onyx Hand and Moonfang Pack learned to fear the silver-blessed blades.

The Supernatural Sovereignty Act has complicated their reputation. The Order's goals now align with the Iron Legion's, making them uncomfortable allies—or willing collaborators, depending on who you ask. Some Templars embrace the Legion's efficiency; others worry about losing their independence to the military machine.

The current High Inquisitor walks a careful line, accepting Legion support while maintaining the Order's autonomy. Not all Templars agree with this compromise.`,

        lore: `The Adventurer's League began as a mutual aid society for traveling warriors, mages, and rogues who made their living taking dangerous jobs. Over centuries, it evolved into a semi-professional organization with chapters in every major city.

Unlike military orders or mercenary companies, the League doesn't deploy units—it certifies individuals. An Adventurer's League badge tells potential employers that the bearer has been vetted, their skills verified, and their reputation tracked.

The League maintains strict political neutrality. A Gold-ranked adventurer might work for the Iron Legion one week and the Liberated Toads the next. This neutrality is protected by the simple fact that everyone needs adventurers—and blacklisting the League means losing access to the realm's most capable problem-solvers.

The current conflict has been a boom time for adventurers. There's never been more work available—or more ways to die.`,

        lore: `The Shadow Weavers have existed in some form since civilization began accumulating things worth stealing. The current organization emerged from the unification of competing criminal gangs approximately two centuries ago.

They operate on a simple principle: crime is inevitable, so it should be organized. Freelance criminals are bad for business—they draw attention, leave witnesses, and undercut prices. Under the Weavers, crime is professional, predictable, and profitable.

Their services are available to anyone with coin and discretion. Need someone killed? There's a price list. Need something stolen? They have specialists. Need to disappear? They know every hidden route in the realm.

The current conflict has been complicated for the Weavers. The Iron Legion's order and surveillance makes traditional crime harder, but war creates new opportunities in smuggling, espionage, and assassination. The Liberated Toads have proven surprisingly good customers.`,

        lore: `The Veneration of the Stars is the oldest organized religion in the Mushroom Kingdom, predating the current royal dynasty. The Star Spirits themselves—Eldstar, Mamar, Skolar, Muskular, Misstar, Klevar, and Kalmar—are said to dwell in Star Haven, granting wishes to the worthy.

The Church operates temples in every major settlement, providing healing to the sick, comfort to the grieving, and moral guidance to all who seek it. Their clerics are trained in divine magic, channeling the power of the stars.

The assassination of Princess Peach in 955 BF devastated the Church—she was considered divinely blessed. The century of civil war that followed tested their faith severely. Many believe the current chaos is a consequence of failing to protect her.

The Iron Legion's invasion has forced the Church into difficult decisions. Some clerics counsel cooperation; others quietly support resistance movements. The Star Spirits themselves have been unusually silent.`,
