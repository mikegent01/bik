    description: "In a stunning lack of tactical awareness, anarchist Archie Miser publicly responded to Captain Toadette's post about her loyalty test. He criticized her methods and attempted to recruit her soldiers and the Liberated Toads into a rival 'army'. The move triggered a massive flame war, alienating nearly all of his allies and amusing his enemies.",
