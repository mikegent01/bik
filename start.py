start.py — serve the Waluipedia locally and open its control panel.

The site is static (see README: "Open index.html and it runs"), but opening it
straight off the filesystem breaks the parts that matter most: `fetch()` calls
against `Reputation-Matrix2/data/*.json` are blocked by the browser's CORS rules
on `file://`, so events, characters, props and investigations silently fail to
load. Serving over HTTP fixes that, and this script is the one-command way to do
it.

    python3 start.py                 # serve + the control panel (http://localhost:8765/panel)
    python3 start.py --no-gui        # the plain terminal server (the panel page still answers)
    python3 start.py --port 9000     # pick the port
    python3 start.py --no-browser    # just serve (headless / remote boxes)
    python3 start.py --route "#/article/the_belly_of_the_beast"
    python3 start.py --host 0.0.0.0  # expose on the network / in a container
    python3 start.py --workflow      # also run workflow/server.py (chat + model bridge)
    python3 start.py --no-sheets     # skip the character-sheet suite (tools/sheets-suite.py --watch)
    python3 start.py --foundry-data "C:/Users/me/AppData/Local/FoundryVTT/Data"   # where the suite publishes for Foundry (found automatically otherwise)

The control panel is a page on the site server itself (tools/control-panel.html
at /panel): a switch per thing that can run — the workflow server (chat + LM
Studio bridge), the character-sheet suite (the GM's Foundry export → world
mirror → player sheets at ledger XP → sheets.json + the import packets Foundry
pulls back), the Qwen3-TTS studio (off unless you tick it) — live status lights,
the log, the remembered ticks (~/.waluipedia-start.json), and buttons that
open the other rooms: the site, the chatroom, the sheets, the Waluipedia Hub,
the Token Plate Studio and the NPC Forge (each its own process, launched from
here). The ticked services start when start.py starts, so a double-click on
start.bat brings everything up.

Ctrl-C (or the panel's Shut down) stops it. Nothing is built — this only
serves the repository as it already exists.
