        summary: "The team's journey takes them into a ruined city where they shoot down a plane and confront its pilot, Reese, a member of the powerful 'Alpones' PMC. A series of traps, ambushes, and betrayals results in the complete annihilation of the team. After respawning, they find a massive hoard of gold, but their attempt to fortify a church ends in another massacre. A new companion, Bill, guides them into an underwater trap, and the chaos culminates in an ambush where they discover their missing friend EighthHalo is now an enemy. Bill's own treachery is revealed when he leads them to his powerful ally, Sid. The team is forced to kill Bill, defeats Sid, and discovers a note revealing their radio calls were intercepted. Their victory is short-lived as they rescue a tortured Jack from a basement, only to be immediately ambushed by a bizarre 'Mega X Furry Unit.' Regrouping, they encounter a cryptic informant who points them towards a Mega X splinter group. This new lead brings them to a scientist who reveals she is a double agent, then lures them into a workshop trap after exposing Mega X's true plan: to ruin the team's reputation by kidnapping their friends. The arc culminates in a hopeless battle against a massive horde, including bizarre new 'Furry Units'. Trapped in a cycle of defeat, their subsequent attempt to ambush a lone soldier with newly crafted golden gear results in another instant total-party-kill, cementing their desperate situation at the church sanctuary. Their escape attempts continue to be disastrous, with a plane crash on a bridge caused by the Reaper Twins leading them to discover yet another lone Mega X scientist, whom they attempt to manipulate for information.",
