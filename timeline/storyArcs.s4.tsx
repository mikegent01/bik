        summary: "The entire campaign is reframed by a grand proclamation from MegaX, the self-proclaimed 'King of YouTube.' He announces he has left his ultimate treasure—his channel and all its assets—in 'one piece' for the adventurers to find, kicking off a massive treasure hunt. The first leg of this new journey is a dramatic retelling of the airship's destruction and the chaotic siege on the floating castle, including the team's capture, a desperate prison break, and their final escape with the first piece of treasure: a glowing green slimeball.",
