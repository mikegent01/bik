/* Discovered Technology — the 3D recipes.
 *
 * Every entry in Reputation-Matrix2/data/technology.json names a `model.recipe`
 * and a `model.palette`. A recipe is a function that returns a list of parts
 * (boxes, cylinders, spheres, tori, lathes, prisms, groups) built with the
 * helpers below; tech-gl.js turns the list into a shaded, turnable model with
 * no library and no network. Palette keys ('body', 'brass', …) resolve to the
 * entry's colours, so one recipe can serve several entries (the two radios)
 * and a new piece of technology can be filed by picking the nearest recipe and
 * giving it a palette — or by adding a recipe here.
 *
 * The models are read off the filings: the helicopter has the searchlight that
 * "was not sweeping the valley", the belly hatch the claw dropped from and the
 * yellow light the fired pilot knew about; the claw is yellow-and-black with the
 * W on its housing and the smaller pincer beside it; the cannon has a Bullet
 * Bill in the muzzle because that is what it fires; the survey machine has the
 * flower that fixed it. tools/render-tech-models.mjs renders all of them to PNG
 * with the site's own rasteriser so they can be looked at without a browser.
 *
 * Classic script: index.html and the node tools both `new Function` it.
 * tools/check-technology.py reads recipe names from lines matching `T.<name> =`.
