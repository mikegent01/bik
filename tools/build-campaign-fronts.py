"""Derive the home page's "Current fronts" strip from the filed events.

The strip answers one question: **where is each campaign right now?** It was
previously hand-curated in `mainPage.campaignCovers`, and hand-curation is why
it went stale twice - the Mario front still pointed at The Garden Above the
Fire after The Tape and the Wario Files was filed, and the Feyward front still
pointed at the Library Reclamation after the Doorway session. Every future
session would have had the same failure mode.

So the covers are now *derived*. A session's campaign comes from its
`timeCode` suffix, which the date guide already requires and
`tools/check-timecodes.py` already validates:

    SHD -> Shadeward      FEY -> Feyward
    MAT -> Mario          SUBJ -> Subjective
    KIV -> Kivotos      EBO -> Mount Ebott

The newest filed event per suffix wins, "newest" being position in
`events.json` (last = newest), which is the same ordering the Recent
Adventures feed uses. One cover per campaign: a campaign holding two cards
pushes another campaign off the strip entirely.

Only events carrying BOTH a timeCode and an image can front a campaign - a
cover with no art is not a cover. An event that is newer but has no image is
skipped with a note rather than silently ignored, because that is usually a
missing-art bug rather than an intentional omission.
